# Get started
- Install a Lightning wallet on your phone or computer (see 'Which wallets are supported' for a list of wallets).
- Transfer funds using a bank transfer or another payment method. You can find the bank transfer details under your "Account" tab.
  Make sure to also copy-and-paste the payment description.
- As soon as we get your payment, you will get a notification that you can withdraw your bitcoin.
- Open the app and click withdraw. Your wallet should open automatically. For withdrawal using the web client, copy paste an invoice in the [web client](https://app.flitz.be).
- After confirming in your wallet, you will receive your funds. Congratulations!
