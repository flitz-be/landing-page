You can use any wallet on the web client by copy-pasting an LN invoice, but for the best user experience on mobile we recommend the following wallets:

- [Phoenix Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.acinq.phoenix.mainnet)
- [Bluewallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bluewallet.bluewallet)  (custodial)
- [Breez Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.breez.client)
- [Wallet of Satoshi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.livingroomofsatoshi.wallet) (custodial)
- [Zebedee Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.zebedee.wallet) (custodial, integrated with a gaming platform).
