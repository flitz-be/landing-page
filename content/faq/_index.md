{{< faq "What information do we collect and why?" >}}
Because we are a regulated company in Belgium that convert euro to bitcoin on behalf of our customers, we collect the following information from our customers when they sign up:

- E-mail
- Full name
- Country of residence 

When you send us a bank transfer, we get this information as well, so giving us 
this information at sign-up time allows us to check this information, but you are
not giving up information that would not be available to us anyway when you are using our platform.
