{{< faq "What information do we collect and why?" >}}
Because we are a regulated company in Belgium that convert euro to bitcoin on behalf of our customers, we collect the following information from our customers when they sign up:

- E-mail
- Full name
- Country of residence 

When you send us a bank transfer, we get this information as well, so giving us 
this information at sign-up time allows us to check this information, but you are
not giving up information that would not be available to us anyway when you are using our platform.

{{< faq "How do the contacts work?" >}}
#### Where are contacts stored
When you add a Flitz contact, it is added in local storage on your phone. We do not hold your contact info server-side, so if you lose
your phone or your data gets erased, you have to add your contacts again.

#### Add a contact
- To add a Flitz contact, ask your contact for their Flitz ID. This is the same ID that you use as the description when you send us a SEPA payment.
- To add a Strike contact, ask your contact for their Strike username.

#### Flitz Contacts
When you send money to a Flitz contact, you don't send money to them directly but rather to us, Flitz Technologies. We immediately give the recipient a notification to let them know they have funds available to withdraw, which they can and should do immediately.
#### Strike Contacts
Strike is a bitcoin-native neo-bank, operating in the US and El Salvador.
When you send money to a Strike contact, you send it directly from your phone to their Strike account. Flitz Technologies does not interfere in any way, as your phone speaks directly to Strike.
#### Limits
- For sending money to Flitz Contacts, the limit is 50 euro per payment.
- For sending money to Strike contacts, Strike's own limits are in place.

#### Information shared
- When you share your Flitz ID with people, they will see your profile picture and your first name.

#### Profile picture
You can change your profile picture on your account page.
