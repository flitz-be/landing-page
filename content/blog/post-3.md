# Insanely simple

There are many platforms that claim to be the most simple way to buy bitcoin, but we believe they are all wrong. A typical platform requires a lot of hoops to jump through before you can actually convert your euro's to bitcoin:

- Give up an insane amount of personal information, before you are even allowed to sign in.
- Send some funds to the exchange.
- Manually buy bitcoin once your funds show up on the platform.
- Withdraw your bitcoin (if your platform allows it), paying giant network fees now and in the future.

The problems we have with this approach are numerous:

- I don't want to do a "look left, look right, show your ID, do a TikTok Dance - video-selfie" just because I want to buy a small amount of bitcoin every month.
- I already have a place to store my euro's, it's called a bank account.
- I already have a place to store my BTC, it's called a wallet. Hell, I have about 12 Lightning wallet on my cellphone alone.

Because of this, we designed Flitz on the following principles:

- No invasive KYC when buying small amounts.
- Any euro's you send to us are immediately converted to BTC.
- Once we receive your funds, you get a notification and you can and should withdraw them immediately over the Lightning Network.

I mean, come on. Pretty cool right?
