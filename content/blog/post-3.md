There are many platforms that claim to be the most simple way to buy bitcoin, but we believe they are all wrong. A typical platform requires a lot of hoops to jump through before you can actually convert your euro's to bitcoin:

- Give up an insane amount of personal information, before you are even allowed to sign in.
- Send some funds to the exchange.
- Manually buy bitcoin once your funds show up on the platform.
- Withdraw your bitcoin (if your platform allows it), paying giant network fees now and in the future.

The problems we have with this approach are numerous:

- I don't want to do a "look left, look right, show your ID, do a TikTok Dance - video-selfie" just because I want to buy a small amount of bitcoin every month.
- I already have a place to store my euro's, it's called a bank account.
- I already have a place to store my BTC, it's called a wallet. Hell, I have about 12 Lightning wallet on my cellphone alone.

Because of this, we designed Flitz on the following principles:

- No invasive KYC. We can do this because we only allow you to buy small amounts of bitcoin each month, and we have enough information about you in the metadata that is included in your SEPA transfer to us.
- Any euro's you send to us are immediately converted to BTC at the most competetive rate possible.
- Once we receive your funds, you get a notification and you can and should withdraw them immediately over the Lightning Network.

Other platforms might have Lightning Network support, but they are all designed in a way that includes them having custody over your funds, and withdrawing them to your own wallet might be possible but is certainly not user-friendly. **Our philosphy is that withdrawing to your own wallet should be the default and should be as easy as possible**.

I mean, come on. Pretty cool right?
