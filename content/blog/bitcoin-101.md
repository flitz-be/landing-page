# Introduction

Flitz is a Lightning Network gateway that allows you to buy Bitcoin. If you're new to all of this, that phrase must sound like absolute gibberish to you. To understand the Lightning Network, one must first understand Bitcoin. And to understand Bitcoin, one must first understand Euro's !
So, I'll start of by explaining traditional currencies.

Money is such a central part of society that it's impossible for people to give any coherent definition of it. Yes you might have heard about the Holy Trinity: Store of Value, Medium of Exchange and Unit of Account. But that's a load of ðŸ’© that boomer economists tend to throw around to hide the fact that economics isn't even a real science. They're all just making stuff up as they go along. 

Instead of rigorous definitions, how does an average person's interaction with money go?

- You open a bank account. 
- Get a job, watch as the number on your bank account goes up by a certain amount every month.
- Watch as the number decreases because of your monthly rent payment.
- Go get some groceries: Swipe your card at the shop.
- Buy stuff online: Pay with your card online
- Dream of buying a house: Go ask your parents for a boatload of money, go beg the bank to give you a loan, and pay an exorbitant amount of money to someone who already has multiple houses. Hope the ridiculous real estate market lasts forever so you're not the one holding the bag.

As Satoshi said himself, the problem here is all the trust that's required, at every level of the pyramid. There are 2 main themes here: privacy and purchasing power. And they are both manifestations of existing oligarchs (both in the private sector and in the government) trying to grab more and more power.

- Your privacy when doing non-cash payment is non-existent. Wether you use a credit card, a debit card, an online payment, your bank app: the data of your transactions is monitored, aggregated, sold to everyone under the sun that pays for it, and flagged if it is deemed inappropriate. Between the moment you sweep your card and the money appears on the merchant's bank account, they are processed by a legion of payment processors, credit cards companies, and god knows who.
