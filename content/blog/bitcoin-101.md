# Introduction

Flitz is a Lightning Network gateway that allows you to buy Bitcoin. If you're new to all of this, that phrase must sound like absolute gibberish to you. To understand the Lightning Network, one must first understand Bitcoin. And to understand Bitcoin, one must first understand Euro's !
So, I'll start of by explaining traditional currencies.

Money is such a central part of society that it's impossible for people to give any coherent definition of it. Yes you might have heard about the Holy Trinity: Store of Value, Medium of Exchange and Unit of Account. But that's a load of ðŸ’© that boomer economists tend to throw around to hide the fact that economics isn't even a real science. They're all just making stuff up as they go along. 

Instead of rigorous definitions, how does an average person's interaction with money go?

- You open a bank account. 
- Get a job, watch as the number on your bank account goes up by a certain amount every month.
- Watch as the number decreases because of your monthly rent payment.
- Go get some groceries: Swipe your card at the shop.
