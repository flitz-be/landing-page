In order to start using Flitz, you will need the following:

- A smartphone or tablet (Android / iOS).
- The ability to open your e-mail on your phone. 
- A bank account on your name in one of our supported countries.



1. Install the app from the Play Store or the App Store.
2. Log in with your e-mail. You will get a log-in link that you can open on your phone, which should open the app and send you to the screen to complete your account details.
3. Fill in your information.
4. Under your account details, you can find our IBAN and your personal reference ID. You can copy these to easily paste them in your SEPA transfer.
5. Open your banking platform, and make a SEPA transfer to our IBAN, with your reference ID as a (non-structured) message. Please respect our transaction limits, or your transaction will be declined.
6. Wait for a bit. If your bank supports SEPA instant payments, the payment will go through in a couple of minutes. Otherwise, a couple of bussiness days delay is possible.
7. Make sure you have a suitable Lightning wallet installed on your smartphone. See the wallet section (under "Explore") in the app for an overview of wallets that are supported.
8. As soon as we receive your payment, we convert it into Bitcoin and send you a notification that your order is ready.
9. A new order will be ready to withdraw in the app. Simply tap the big button and your wallet should open automatically. You need to confirm again in your wallet and wait for some time. It's possible your wallet gives an error if the payment takes too long, but it might go through or fail after some time. If it should fail, you will be able to try again (possibly with another wallet) in the app.
