Because we are a regulated company in Belgium that convert euro to bitcoin on behalf of our customers, we collect the following information from our customers when they sign up:

- E-mail
- Full name
- Country of residence 

When you send us a bank transfer, we get this information as well, so giving us 
this information at sign-up time allows us to check this information, but you are
not giving up information that would not be available to us anyway when you are using our platform.

When doing a bank transfer or electronic payment, please keep in mind that we require the following conditions to be met:

- Your bank account originates from your country of residence.
- The name on your bank account must match the name that you have submitted to us.
- From your first payment onwards, your bank account will be fixed. Subsequent payments will need to come from the same bank account as the first one.

For more information on our collection of personal information, see our [Privacy policy](https://flitz.be/privacy-policy).
